# ABOUT THE COURSE 

This course, entitled "The Language of the Birds" is based on the Awakening to Languages learning methodology for adults and its purpose is to bring together Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic speakers. Ideally, it is aimed at speakers of these languages, although it can also be approached by anyone interested in plural aproaches in language teaching. In order to understand the instructions and the content material you need to have a at least a **C1 reading level in English**. 

It is important to mention that the completion of the full course (including the video-call sessions) will require you to reach the instructor at some point so you can arrange the virtual meetings with the other students.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

These are some of the main learning objectives that will be covered in this 10-hour online course:

- 1. **Fostering language diversity, plurilingualism and multiculturalism.**

Participants can learn from each otherâ€™s languages and cultures, gaining insights into different ways of thinking and expressing ideas. This mutual learning experience can enhance cognitive flexibility and empathy.

- 2. **Promoting multi-cultural communication.**

By engaging speakers of these three languages, the course will enhance cross-cultural dialogue, breaking down barriers and building bridges between different linguistic communities through a series of video-call sessions led by an instructor. 

- 3. **Raising language and linguistics awareness.**

The students will gain some valuable knowledge of linguistics aspects of the three languages which most language learning courses don't offer. 

- 4. **Contributing to professional and personal development.**

 In our interconnected world, knowledge of Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic can open up numerous professional opportunities. The course can be a stepping stone for adults looking to expand their career prospects in international fields.
