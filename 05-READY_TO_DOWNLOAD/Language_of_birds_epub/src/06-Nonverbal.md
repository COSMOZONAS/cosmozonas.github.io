# NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION

## WHAT IS NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION?

Non-verbal communication is fundamental in languages because it conveys a great deal of information that goes beyond words. Non-verbal elements such as tone of voice, intonation, posture and eye contact complement and enrich the verbal message, allowing a better understanding of the interlocutor and revealing emotions and attitudes that may not be expressed verbally. In addition, non-verbal communication can be a more reliable indicator of a person's intentions or feelings, as it occurs more subconsciously and is less susceptible to conscious control. Non-verbal communication is essential for full and effective human interaction, and its study and understanding can significantly improve the quality of our communication.
