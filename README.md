In Abrahamic and European mythology, medieval literature and occultism,the language of the birds is considered a mystical, perfect divine language, often associated with wisdom and enlightenment. It’s believed to be the language used by birds to communicate with the initiated and is sometimes seen as a metaphor for understanding the secrets of the gods or the universe.

# 1. ABOUT THE COURSE

- 3. **Raising language and linguistics awareness.**

The students will gain some valuable knowledge of linguistics aspects of the three languages which most language learning courses don't offer.
