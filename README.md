# THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIRDS

In Abrahamic and European mythology, medieval literature and occultism,the language of the birds is considered a mystical, perfect divine language, often associated with wisdom and enlightenment. It’s believed to be the language used by birds to communicate with the initiated and is sometimes seen as a metaphor for understanding the secrets of the gods or the universe.

This NOOC, entitled "The Language of the Birds" is based on the Awakening to Languages learning methodology for adults and it is aimed at bringing together Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic speakers. The only requirement for the course user is to have a **B2+/C1 or C2 of English reading level** to understand the instructions and content material.  

These are some of the main learning objectives that will be covered in this 10-hour online course:

## 1. Fostering language diversity, plurilingualism and multiculturalism.

Participants can learn from each other’s languages and cultures, gaining insights into different ways of thinking and expressing ideas. This mutual learning experience can enhance cognitive flexibility and empathy.

## 2. Promoting multi-cultural communication.

By engaging speakers of these three languages, the course will enhance cross-cultural dialogue, breaking down barriers and building bridges between different linguistic communities through a series of video-call sessions led by an instructor. 

## 3. Raising language and linguistics awareness.

The students will gain some valuable knowledge of linguistics aspects of the three languages which most language learning courses don't offer. 

## 4. Contributing to professional and personal development.

 In our interconnected world, knowledge of Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic can open up numerous professional opportunities. The course can be a stepping stone for adults looking to expand their career prospects in international fields.

This NOOC can be a powerful platform for adult learners to enhance their language skills, cultural understanding, and global awareness, making it a valuable experience.
