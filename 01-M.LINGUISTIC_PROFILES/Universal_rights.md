# PREFACE TO THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF LINGUISTIC RIGHTS

>An old legend says that, a long time ago, there was a king who heard that in his country there lived a truly wise man. He was so wise, they said, that he could speak all the languages in the world. He knew the song of the birds and understood it as if he were one of them. He knew how to read the shape of the clouds and immediately understand their meaning. Any language he listened to, he could answer without hesitation. He could even read the thoughts of men and women wherever they came from. 

>The king, impressed by all the qualities that were attributed to him, called him to his palace. And the wise man came.
When he was there, the king asked him: 

>"Wise man, is it true that you know all the languages of the world?"

>"Yes, Sir," was the answer.
>"Is it true that that you listen to the birds and you can understand their song?"

>"Yes, Sir."

>"That you know how to read the shape of the clouds?"

>"Yes, Sir."

>"And, as I have been told, that you can even read people's minds?"

>"Yes, Sir."

>The king still had a last question...

>But, which question would we put to the wisest of all the wise men?
Which languages from all over the world are spoken by the authors of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights? Countless, we would dare to say. In any case, from more than 90 states and 5 continents, more than 200 people gathered on June 6th, 1996, in Barcelona to proclaim the Declaration.

>Some represented small local NGOs committed to teaching a language not recognized by the official education system of their country. There were writers in many different languages who use their language every day to create literary universes open to all. Others represented international NGOs whose mission is the defence of linguistic rights. Others were experts in law, in languages, in sociolinguistics and in various fields of knowledge which converge in the academic study of linguistic rights.

>For all of them, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights promises a future of coexistence and peace thanks to the recognition of the right that each linguistic community has to shape its own life in its own language in all fields. And so they proclaimed. Since then, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights has spread: each month there is news about its translation into a new language, a new affiliation of someorganization that might not have been associated to the process, or about an international personality who has decided to support the Declaration and with it the defence of all languages in an international context which threatens the survival of many of them.

>That original text, written, amended, approved and proclaimed at non-governmental level wants nevertheless to contribute to the work of the United Nations. It aims to be a strong motivation, an appeal to the states so that, in the dynamics started by the Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, they would recognize the linguistic rights of the individuals and of their communities. The association of UNESCO to our process from the very beginning and the work it has been doing along these lines gives us hope that some day a normative body of the United Nations regulating the defence of linguistic rights all over the world will be approved. 

>This book wants to contribute to this work.In this book the text of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights appears and it is explained how it was written and proclaimed in the World Conference on Linguistic Rights. It is the work done by 61 NGOs, 41 PEN Club centres and over 40 experts in linguistic rights, coming from the five continents.The testimony of well-known personalities from all over the world also appears, as well as that of writers and people who fight for rights, for peace and who wanted to join us in this project. 

>We all, like that king in the fairy tale, may put the last question to that wise man who knew all the languages of the world. The king looked at him as if defying him, as if testing him, and asked him the final question:

>"In my hands, which are hidden behind my back, there is a bird. Wise man, answer me: is it alive or dead?"
The answer of the wise man was addressed to everybody. In our case, to everybody who has any responsibility in promoting linguistic rights, from the activist to the writer, from the teacher to the legislator. 

>For that wise man, surprisingly, felt scared. He knew that, whatever the answer, the king could kill the bird. He looked at the king and remained silent for a long time. Finally, in a very serene voice he said,
"The answer, Sir, is in your hands."

>The answer is in our hands.
